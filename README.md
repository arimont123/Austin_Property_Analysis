# Austin_Property_Analysis
Initial Hypothesis: Do location or landmarks affect the value of properties in Austin, Texas?

Questions:
Where were the most desirable zip codes?
Which property types were most common in those areas?
How did age of home affect the current home value?
What decade saw the largest increase of homes built? 
Were there outliers in the data?

Summary: 
Houses that were closer to downtown and Lake Travis saw in increase in price. Homes near downtown had a higher price per square foot than homes
near Lake Travis, but homes near Lake Travis had an overall higher market value. 
Over the span of the century, more homes were built each year with a few exceptions. 
Single family residences (houses) were the most common type across the 5 zip codes (see post mortem for why we excluded apartment complexes). 
Homes in 78702 (East Austin) had the largest variance of current market value.
